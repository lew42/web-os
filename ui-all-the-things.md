# Visualize all the things

Git has a terrible UI.  GitHub's web interface is satisfactory, but it's not great.  Their attempt at a desktop app is a fail, in my opinion.

Version control is the most important aspect of software, and spans all 

* version control (saving, branching, bookmarking/tagging, pushing, pulling, merging, conflict resolution, etc)
* granular version control (every variable name, condition, function, class, module, template, document, widget, application)
* debugging (see all the variable values)
* logging (organize the output)
* networking
