But what does a browsable version tree look like?  I can't really tell you that.  All examples I've seen make the simple concept of a version tree, and make it really complex.

Here are some images of existing "GUI" version control apps:

I've used all three of these apps, and went back to using the command line.  I didn't really understand the branching diagrams (maybe I'm just stupid).  Maybe they didn't label the different branches well enough?  Maybe I don't understand git well enough?  Or maybe I just didn't give it enough time.  I think all of the above are true to some degree. 

This function (version control) needs to be consistent across all apps.  And needs to be able to touch all the things within files (transcend the file system).

Feel free to open an issue if this doesn't make sense, or if you have any comments.
