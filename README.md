Rebuild all the things, with JavaScript:

* git, npm
* WordPress, Wikipedia, Reddit, StackOverflow
* Facebook, Google, YouTube
* Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator, After Effects

I need your help.  If you're interested, just follow this project.

The "ultimate content management system" is more like a web operating system.  The core pillars of any operating system should be:

* version control (for code, data, designs, and all things)
* modular (composable, from 0 lines of code to... anything)
* extendable (packages/plugins, plugins for plugins)
* marketplace (browse for packages/plugins, with monetization and advanced licensing)
* user authentication (supports the authorship, licensing, monetization, etc)
* visual (user interface for everything - say goodbye to the command line)

All of these things should be built in the same language.  My language of choice is JavaScript.  And not that funky transpiling to a zillion flavors of ES9000.

My vision is a system of Object Oriented programming that has less to do with JavaScript, and more to do with logic, lowering the learning curve, etc.
