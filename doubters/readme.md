# To all the doubters:

## Why do I think this is possible?  

Because it *already exists*.  The technology is there.  It's just scattered amongst hundreds of different complex systems.  Combining these systems offers many obvious synergies, and I can't imagine how many more that aren't so obvious.

## "But it would require a million developer-hours to complete."

We have working prototypes of all the pieces.  WordPress, Wikipedia, Facebook, StackOverflow, Slack, etc.  And if the platform is unified, you don't need to re-engineer the basics (authentication, hosting, dev ops, etc).

And if it's open source, we can get a million developers to each contribute an average of one hour.  Why not?

And, if we figure out how to speed up the development process, we can cut the number of hours to a half-million.  Or quarter-million.

I've been trying to create a better debugging environment, to visualize the data and test cases for each function.  Something in-between the current dev tools (stepping through code) and the console.log (messy).

And the design environment (something like Webflow) needs to be built into the IDE, so that any class can be easily prototyped, populating the fields, forms, CRUD, etc.
