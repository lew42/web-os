# M3 (Monetized Module Marketplace)

`npm` is a marketplace for modules, but it's not monetized.  Would monetization inhibit the marketplace (the quality and quantity of modules)?

That's the brilliance of a free market: it is self regulating.  If a price is too high, the product won't sell.  

However, the major difference is the incentive for developers to create and publish high quality modules.  With $0 incentive, why should anyone give up their nights and weekends to make something awesome?

If you could devote a few months to producing something great, and potentially retire early - the incentive is there.  The quality and quantity of modules will increase.

But how do developers more efficiently find modules, learn about them, and figure out how to implement them?

We want to reduce friction at all levels.  Make the system as efficient as possible.
