# M3 (Monetized Module Marketplace)

First read [open-source vs monetization](monetization.md).

## Absolutes
* quality and quantity are important: the larger the marketplace, and better quality of modules, the better
* monetiz

`npm` is a *marketplace* for *modules*, but it's not *monetized*.  Would monetization inhibit the quality and quantity of modules?

That's the brilliance of a free market: it's self regulating.  If a price is too high, the product won't sell, and/or others will compete.

The major difference here, is the incentive for developers to create and publish high quality modules.  With $0 incentive, why should someone give up their nights and weekends to make something awesome?

On the other hand, if you could produce something great, and potentially retire early - the incentive is there.  The quality and quantity of modules will increase.  This is a requirement for the ultimate operating system.

This ensures that if features are lacking, they will be added.  A self-optimizing software platform.  Is [Windows, Mac, Linux, Web, WordPress] self-optimizing?  It's arguable.  But the real question is, how do you make this self-optimization most efficient?
